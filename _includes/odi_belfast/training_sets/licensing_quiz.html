    <h2>ONS Postcode Products</h2>
        <p>Our postcode products (derived from Code-Point® Open) are subject to the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/">Open Government Licence</a> and the Ordnance Survey OpenData Licence.</p>
        <p>If you also use the Northern Ireland data (postcodes starting with “BT”), you need a separate licence for commercial use direct from Land and Property Services. We only issue a <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/methodology/geography/licences/lpsenduserlicenceoct11_tcm77-278044.doc">Northern Ireland End User Licence</a> (for internal business use only) with the data.</p>
        <p>Use of the Northern Ireland data contained within the ONS postcode products constitutes acceptance of the Northern Ireland licensing terms and conditions.</p>
